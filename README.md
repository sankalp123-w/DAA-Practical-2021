- ## RB-tree
A red-black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the colour (red or black)
- Inserstion - T(N) is O(nlog(n))
- Search- T(N) is	O(log n)
- Delete- T(N) is	O(log n)
**“N” is the total number of elements in the red-black tree. ** 
## APPLICATIONS

- Java: java.util.TreeMap , java.util.TreeSet .
- C++ STL: map, multimap, multiset.
- Linux kernel: completely fair scheduler, linux/rbtree.h

- ## MST
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight
- complaxity - T(N) is  O(V^2). 

- ## Sort Methods 
              best    avg    worst
- Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2) 
- Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
- Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
- Bucket Sort	Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)
